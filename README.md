# MS Office Tools
This repo contains small auxiliary tools for the MS Office. I wrote them for
myself, but while searching for a solution, I saw that also others seem to have
the same problem and could profit.

## PPT Globally Change Languages
The MS PowerPoint language management for the spell check is lousy. Basically,
you would have to select every text field and change the language to change it.
This gets especially painful if you work in an international company, where
documents are edited in different lingual environments and may contain multiple
languages.

This tool allows to globally apply a language via VBA macro.
